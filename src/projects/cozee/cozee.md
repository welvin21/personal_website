### Description

[Cozee](https://github.com/welvin21/cozee) is a furniture aggregator application which brings furniture sellers and customers together. With the implementation of AR/VR technology, we let customers visualize how furnitures will look at their home. On the seller side, we provide a portal for them to upload their furnitures alongside with all the relevant data related such as price, category, etc. Lastly, our image to 3D object rendering functionality makes [Cozee](https://github.com/welvin21/cozee) even more special. Sellers only need to feed our server with relevant images of their products from different angles, our backend will then convert the data into a 3D object model. The 3D object model will be saved on our system and can be consumed by the customers for visualization purpose.

The project was built in **48 hours** during [The 2019 Smartone Hackathon](https://www.smartonehackathon.com/).
