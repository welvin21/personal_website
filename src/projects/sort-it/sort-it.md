title: 'Sort It'
excerpt: 'A sorting algorithm visualizer to make learning process easier for everyone.'
---

### Description

[SortIt](https://sort.welvin21.com) is a sorting algorithms visualizer that is running on the web. There 10 different sorting algorithms available on [SortIt](https://sort.welvin21.com). Some of them are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

[SortIt](https://sort.welvin21.com) started off as a personal project with the motivation to help everyone understand different sorting techniques better. When I first learnt about sorting algorithms, I often found it hard to get the hang of them by just looking at the code implementations. By providing a visualizer where people can see and track the movement of each element in the array, I hope it learning process can be easier and more enjoyable for everybody.
