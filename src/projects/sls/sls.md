### Description

[SLS](https://sls.rctech.club) is an IoT project by [RC Tech Club](https://www.rctech.club/) which gives information regarding washing machines status for R.C. Lee hall residents. Since all washing machines in the building are located on the 16<sup>th</sup> floor, often times during peak hours, people had to go back and forth to check if any of the machines is not occupied by someone else. Using [SLS](https://sls.rctech.club), residents need not to worry anymore since the status of all washing machines can be tracked via the internet.
